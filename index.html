	<div class="cd-reviews"><p>Impeccable diction and enunciation, wonderful nuancing of text, and sensational technique make Spence a singer I am eager to hear again...With secure facility and elegant phrasing the excellent accompanist for this program, Andrew Matthews-Owen, expressively draws out the rich palette of sound in Hoddinott’s imaginative writing. <span class="yellow">(American Record Guide)</span></p>
<p><p>Both cycles are given highly nuanced and powerfully projected performances by Nicky Spence, underpinned with some accomplished piano playing from Andrew Matthews-Owen...This recording...bears witness to Hoddinott's fecund imagination and invention in bringing such poetic landscapes to lustrous musical life. <span class="yellow">(Gramophone magazine – Recommended Recording of the Month)</span></p>
<p><p>This is a distinguished record for which the British Music Society deserves high praise...The composer is wonderfully served by these artists: Claire Booth negotiates the demanding soprano lines with seeming effortless ease, and Nicky Spence, in the two main tenor cycles, is astonishingly good. Andrew Matthews-Owen is an admirable partner throughout…an outstanding issue, consistently of very high quality as regards music, performance, recording and presentation. <span class="yellow">(International Record Review)</span></p>
<p><p>If you want to find out what has happened to English song since Britten, this is as good a place to start as any. The four song-cycles on this disc share the characteristics that give Dove his individual voice – not least the skill, perhaps learnt from Britten, to light upon a simple idea that encapsulates a whole song – and yet they are strikingly different. In the unaccompanied Ariel, soprano Claire Booth… so completely embraces the world of The Tempest, glimpsed in shards of Shakespearean text, that the cycle almost feels like an opera in miniature… Nicky Spence puts them across with Pears-like point. The other two cycles fall to mezzo Patricia Bardon. Her singing is all earth and fire in the brief Lorca cycle but All You Who Sleep Tonight, sensuous and playful, is carried to an ecstatic climax on waves of minimalist rhythmic energy… Andrew Matthews-Owen is the supportive accompanist. Here are four highly imaginative new song-cycles, each deserving of a life of its own. <span class="yellow">(Gramophone magazine)</span></p>

	<div class="cd-reviews"><p>Despite Dove's celebrated place as an opera composer and a career so dominated by writing for voices, his songs are not heard often. Here is an excellent opportunity to hear a good sampling of them. <span class="yellow">(American Record Guide)</span></p>
<p><p>I cannot imagine anyone with an interest in singing, or music for voice and piano, or young singers, or British music not responding to this...Dove's music does not sound like Britten, in particular. He seems to have found his own distinctive voice, and relatively early. Others may hear differently, but to hear. they must acquire this superb disc - a purchase I strongly urge! <span class="yellow">(Fanfare magazine)</span></p>
<p><p>These song cycles give the listener another opportunity to engage with the composer’s writing for solo voice. All of them except Ariel here receive their world première recordings. Patricia Bardon encompasses the wide vocal range without any sense of strain, and her diction again is commendably clear… The first performance was given by Tear as soloist, and Nicky Spence here sounds very like his distinguished predecessor in both tone and style although more youthful… Apart from his excellent booklet notes, Andrew Matthews-Owen is a superlative pianist…Throughout these cycles one is grateful to encounter a composer whose writing for the voice, and his understanding of its technique, is so approachable. We must be grateful to Naxos for making these works available in such excellent performances. <span class="yellow">(Musicweb International)</span></p>
<p><p>On this thrilling and satisfying CD from Naxos a collection of representative works by British composer Jonathan Dove leave the listener in no doubt that [his song-writing] is bristling with energy and red blood. Each [work] is performed with great conviction and aplomb by the singers and pianist here. …they completely understand the delicate balance between pushing an object into motion and guiding it throughout the course of its natural vector. Then they pull their hands away; and leave us wanting more. Equally noteworthy is the extent to which pianist and singer create almost orchestral sonorities… Recommended not only as an emblem of how successful and apposite British songwriting is, but as substantial music in its own right. <span class="yellow">(ClassicalNet)</span></p>
<p><p>Elan, intelligence and passionate engagement…technical accomplishment…this is a richly stimulating recital. <span class="yellow">(BBC Music Magazine)</span></p>
<p><p>The four works that make up this delightful anthology demonstrate not only that Jonathan Dove is heir to the 20th-century English song tradition but also that he is one of the most vivid painters of words in music today. <span class="yellow">(Financial Times)</span></p>

	<div class="cd-reviews"><p>A careful and astute selection of some wonderful songs by Debussy and those around him, clustered around an eminently enjoyable new commission from Jonathan Dove. And it's difficult to imagine it much better performed than here...Essentially the emotional centrepiece of the disc nevertheless is Debussy's own ever-remarkable <i>Cinq poemes de Charles de Baudelaire</i>. Booth throws herself fully into their heady world, her voice breathy and open in its timbre and often indecently sensuous - and always used intelligently. Matthews-Owen rises to the challenges of the various piano parts very impressively ..a valuable addition to the catalogue <span class="yellow">(Gramophone)</span></p>
<p><p>In this beautifully curated postlude to the Debussy centenary year, pianist Andrew Matthews-Owen is joined by singers Claire Booth and Susan Bickley in a programme that looks both outward to Debussy's contemporaries and inward to his personal life...It is enchanting...The mood is lifted by songs from Bardac's former lover, Fauré, shared between the two singers, and Bickey sings the quixotic Satie melodies that frame the recital...there is much to enjoy here. Matthews-Owen judges the pace of exquisitely throughout, while the segue from Satie's <i>Vexations</i> to the closing 'Je te veux' is a masterstroke. <span class="yellow">(BBC Music magazine)</span></p>
<p><p>There are plenty of recordings of French art songs from Fauré up through Satie, but this British release has several special features going for it. First is the presence of two fine contrasting voices,  both expertly accompanied by pianist Andrew Matthews-Owen.

<p>The concert was a great success for the Foundation and the two series we organised, bringing several sponsors and a dedicated audience of supporters to the project for the next two years. The series culminated in summer 2010, at a gala concert and discussion with Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. Mr Matthews-Owen was always highly sensitive to the Foundation’s other projects and exhibitions, making sure that the concerts were put together and performed with minimal disruption to the galleries at the Foundation. Mr Matthews-Owen always coordinated the musicians and their rehearsal times in the space and handled their individual needs with great diplomacy, tact and calm understanding. Working with Mr Matthews-Owen has always been a pleasure; he is utterly professional and infectiously enthusiastic about his work. <span class="yellow">(Scott Bauer, Gallery Director, Louise Blouin Foundation, London)</span></p>

<p>Andrew and I worked together on an inaugural concert we were putting on at GS, off the back of discussions he and I had about encouraging music in the workplace. Andrew was a pleasure to work with - he came with plenty of ideas, he was flexible and thoughtful about the audience and what would work best. He was professional at all times and dealt with the logistical side of things in a timely and organised fashion. The concert was a huge success with Andrew and his colleagues putting on a top class performance. <span class="yellow">(Sarah Harper, MD and Head of Recruitment EMEA and India, Goldman Sachs)</span></p>

<p>Andrew has devised many concerts and events for large-scale organisations and bodies. He has curated, and performed in, major retrospectives of composers Claude Debussy and Benjamin Britten at the Southbank Centre for their anniversary years. To mark Britten @ 100, Andrew curated ‘Benjamin Britten: Artistic Crucible’, a three-day festival at Kings Place celebrating the great man’s centenary year. Andrew established and directed the Louise Blouin Concert Series, which saw fascinating evenings of art and music with performances by leading performers, and talks given by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and Michael Berkeley.</p>

<p>In recent years, Andrew has enjoyed taking music into major banks and law firms. For five years he has curated monthly concerts at BNP Paribas for employees to enjoy with their lunch, and two annual concerts in which the employees themselves perform. This has led to duos, trios and chamber music ensembles forming within the bank's workforce. Andrew curated a concert of bankers and lawyers in a fund-raising concert for Desmond Tutu in 2015.</p>
